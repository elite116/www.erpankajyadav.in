    <h2 style="font-size:28px; text-align:left">Home Inverter Wiring Scam(Article)</h2>
    <h3 style="font-size:16px; text-align:left"> September 19, 2022</h3>
     <p style="font-size:20px; text-align:left;">
     Hello everyone!!!hope all are good and happy ….it's been long since I am posting the article. But it's important to know about it. Today's article is about the wiring of inverter in our homes.<br/>
     As all of you had seen that the output of the inverter which supplies the power when the main supply is gone, there a weird thing you will see. Actually only one wire is taken as output and the main
     supply neutral wire is used as the common neutral wire for supply.On asking the reason the technician says that there is no problem and it can work well with that ,or give an answer that the
     neutral is internally connect in the inverter and it won't hurt and simply to save the wire cost, he will give you a larger problem.The problem is of battery. Yes, you read it right. From the
     concept of the power system, the generator sends the current and the same current should come back to the generator because from basic school physics the current flows in a closed path.Here 
     what happens is that the current comes out from the battery, but doesn’t comes back , and goes to the electricity poles neutral whereas in our schools we had seen that the chemical battery 
     experiment that the electrodes only work when connected in a closed path.Now the problem which arises due to this is, positive terminal rusting of the battery…..reduced capacity of storing 
     charge of the battery, because battery is only giving the positive part of the power and not the returning part. So this common neutral myth is a heavy price on your pocket
     Also you can see the difference. The power quality will improve and your house supply will get better when you take both wires from the inverter and not only the single wire.
     So please stop following blindly YouTube or any fake technician or “bijliwala” in India as they say.
     Please feel free to ask me any questions.</p>

        <h3 style="font-size:16px; text-align:left">
            April 4, 2022</h3>
            <p style="font-size:20px; text-align:left;">
                Hello everyone!!! Hope all good and happy at your end. Today's topic is the summer season. Usually we go for the AC, but in many places cooler is a quite last option. So a small advice 
                for the cooler users that many times in running of the cooler the motor in moisture conditions absorbs it. Which in due course reduces the motor life. So in order to save it we mainly 
                use grease. Instead of it, use engine oil or the gear box oil or the oil for gun. This will give you a very visible changing effect.For the AC users, in order to save the power keep 
                the AC at 25-28°C and get it auto switched to either fan mode or completely of if have windows around 2 am. Because at that time outside temperature comes down to normal limit. 
                This will save the electricity bill amount.
                Please feel free to ask me any questions.

            <p style="font-size:20px; text-align:left;">
                Hello everyone!!Hope all are good and vaccinated. This time I would like to bring you a small incident I observed few days back. I want for some shopping for parts of the project. I observed
                that the retail prices of the parts were much higher than the actual product. Why is it so, I enquired. Then on knowing the reality I was shocked. The thing is that first the company makes 
                the products for selling and then in order to avoid the repairing of the products they charge the spare parts to this much level ,and on added it that the service charges , that you might go
                only for the new product. This happens in the laptops, tablets smart phones and many devices which are small in size or have components of the size of small dots. But on international grounds
                of trade, this is a way by which the Indian consumers are cheated and it's unfortunate to say ,but many well educated people will also fall in this trap. So please before going for the repair/service
                ,as this is a season of electronic products getting faulty due to rainy and moist season. Mostly, the products in many cases won't get faulty, it's just a moist presence which when evaporated, gets
                the product working again. So if you are going for a laptop/tablet repair, first try once by keeping it in a closed bag with silica pouches which comes in water bottles when you buy them , or any 
                moist absorbent. Please remember that the battery must be removed or at least the device must be completely switched off. Hope this will help you and make your life much happier.
                Please feel free to ask me any questions.

        <h3 style="font-size:16px; text-align:left">
            August 6, 2021</h3>
            <p style="font-size:20px; text-align:left;">
                Hello everyone!!Today's topic is one which was discovered during a discussion with one of my friend. Actually we were discussing about the capacitors used in the fan. Many times in India, and other
                south Asian countries, the working supply voltage is 230V AC. So accordingly the manufacturer make the fans to work on it. So the value is a calculated value as per a proper formula. Say for an orient
                ceiling fan the capacitor has a value of 2.25 MFD. So accordingly, the fan works perfectly, but here is the real catch. The 2.25 MFD capacitor is usually not available in the local market and they 
                instead fool the people that instead of it use 2.5 MFD so that the speed will increase and you will get better performance. This is a scam. The fan maintains a balance between the capacitor and the 
                windings values. If you increase the capacitor value then it will create an imbalance and this causes fan becomes slower in the long run and many times you face the fan regulator gets faulty. So please
                never replace the manufacturer rating devices with a local repair shop advised rating devices. This will be an unnecessary and loss gathering strategy.
                Please feel free to ask me any questions.

        <h2 style="font-size:28px; text-align:left">WFH(Work From Home)(Article)</h2>
        <h3 style="font-size:16px; text-align:left">
            June 12, 2021</h3>
            <p style="font-size:20px; text-align:left;">
                In recent times we all are aware of this term very well. It's today's culture and I am pretty sure of its future aspects as well. So, in this time, the power demand of homes becomes much more than the 
                demand of the industries. As per the data of UN, the energy demand in the domestic sector increases 50 times than there previous demand in the same time. Frame this also causes us a hefty bill of electricity.
                Since it's directly proportional high carbon emissions, so what can we do for it. Here are some points!!<br /><br />
                1.&nbsp;In day time use as much possible, the sunlight for lighting, if in a closed location, use reflection mirrors for bringing light into the home.<br />
                2.&nbsp;Use the laptop without charger connected in home. Please do it when only you had battery level of 20% or less.<br />
                3.&nbsp;When working from home, do not use a continuous running of ac cooling, instead cool your room periodically and use the after cooling effect .this saves a lot of electricity and also keeps your body temperature 
                    as per the outside weather and as well as according to the season.<br />
                4.&nbsp;While working from home, keep the use of battery operated devices as much less as possible, such as tablet or mobile and use the old papers for making notes and writing down important things as we are habitual
                    of these very much and the power consumed in these tasks can saves your electricity bill upto a significant amount and this will also re-nourish your memory skills as well as your health such as eye problems.<br />
                5.&nbsp;Also if you can do this ,then , buy a small solar panel with output voltage same as your car or bike battery and pull your car or bike battery out of your vehicle. And then charge it and use it as an auxiliary power
                    supply for your office section of your home . So this exercise can decrease your electricity demand and in this time when your car or bike is not in use. The battery can be used and it will not discharge , and also it will
                    be in a running condition.<br />
                6.&nbsp;When working from home, please , if possible, use a wired connection of internet from the point to your device instead of using the wireless or Wi-Fi .You can experience an increase in the internet speed and this also reduces
                    power consumption.<br />
                7.&nbsp;Another very useful thing which you can use is the mini solar lamp for night use. You can charge them similar to the thing explained in point no 5 and then you can uses them in night as additional mobile light source.<br />
                8.&nbsp;Keep your high power consuming task for the night, so that the task can be completed as the demand decreases during mid night such as you get good speed of internet around 1 am in Asian countries. This will reduce your
                    power supply consumption as the work will now take less time to complete which can reduce your unit consumption.<br />
                9.&nbsp;In this times of summer season, the survival and focus on the tasks is very tough. So there are many traditional cooling techniques which can help you in reducing your electricity bill such as tree plantation, wet curtains
                    on windows and use of diets which keeps your body temperature cool can ultimately help you in reducing your dependence on electricity .<br />
                10.&nbsp;A small but very helpful technique, this is for moist locations , please use table fan at a height of about 4 feet from the floor in your room instead of AC. this is because in the room the cool air remains at lower level in 
                    the room and the table fan help in circulating it. As the ceiling fan pushes the roof heat from top to bottom. But the table fan circulates it horizontally. This effect can help in reducing the use of AC during work.<br />

                So I hope these tips will help you in the best possible ways and make your WFH much more happier and easy.Please feel free to ask me any questions.

            May 15, 2021</h3>
            <p style="font-size:20px; text-align:left;">
                Hi everyone!!!!this time my topic is on the rusted terminals. Daily we use several equipment’s by connecting them in power socket. After a considerable amount of time, we observe that they had become black. This is due to the atmospheric
                reaction process. This is not good because then more power is needed than usual to first counter this rust and then the power is sent in the appliance. Due to this your overall electricity bill gets unnecessarily increased. So in order 
                to overcome this issue use a sand paper and rub it so that the clean and shiny part will be again visible and a periodical check up can help you in it.
                 Please feel free to ask me any questions.

                Hello everyone!!!!Today is the topic which will show you its effect in future. This time I am pointing towards an unseen pollution developing right below our nose. As being the ignorant humans , we only react when things gets worse upto
                the pandemic level. So ,the concept is EM( electromagnetic ) pollution. Yes , each of the electrical and electronic object has some level of emission of it. That's why you feel very calm ,quite and at peace when you reach in a place where
                no electronic gadget or even power supply is available. This is because these EM waves produces a constant humming motion in our mind and due to this whenever the sudden electricity get shut down in your home's and offices, you after some
                time starts feeling relaxed ,but also gets anxiety due to your habit of checking the screen irrespective of which devices' it is. This as a consequence makes us feel restless. So please stop using unnecessary devices around you as this is
                a very well known fact that excess of anything is bad.

                First of all kind apology for delayed posting, actually I was busy with a project of an electronic consumer product. From there I got a topic for your concern which must be highlighted. Yes I am talking about the repair ability. Nowadays 
                companies are purposely making the products in the Indian market so that they won't get repaired easily , and the consumer is forced to buy a new one . Say ,for example at present the induction cooktop is a consumer product which is highly
                in demand and easily available in purchase ,but the greatest catch is that the circuit designed for this device by many reputed companies having worth of economy , do not provide the main component protection circuit ,which creates the 
                loop hole and the consumer frequently faces the issue of non-operation. As per the govt. guidelines , this is a malpractice in business which is a point of stealing the consumers which also causes the additional electricity bill due to such
                ignorant mind-set of companies that they just want to sell the product. So ,as a smart consumer ,always ask for the repair ability scope of the device and what are the guarantees they provide when it gets damaged or faulty as such 
                unprotected devices can even cause death to many ,which is why in india earlier the electronic products used to work for many years without any issues, but now it's like ”chala to chand tak,warna shaam tak”.

            Many times you might have seen that in your Bill ,that there is one thing called power factor and MDI . Actually they are the points of your load demand for your home.<br /> 
            But , the loop hole lies here are as follows:-<br />
            1.	Many distribution companies simply keeps power factor as “1″ in many domestic consumer bill which is impossible in this world because it means the home as not even a single appliance which produces heat .and how company then gets the profit
                as because the formula for active power calculation is V*I*cos(phi) which we pays. So , when this cos(phi) is 1 that means for V=230 and I=10, the unit consumed is “2.3 units”. Where as if phi is 0.8 which is in actual for homes then the units
                consumed is “1.8 units “. So for a state of 1.5 crore consumers this small factor each month amounts to tens of crores of rupees without getting consumed by the consumer. This is a cheat as you can ask your meter reader for the power factor 
                reading of the month.<br />
            2.	The MDI is Max. Demand Indicator . which is as per the gov.t of India’s notified norms is used to detect the max. current demand of the house for a particular month .So ,when you run say a washing machine and an AC simultaneously ,then the 
                current demand obviously increases and the company records it and for a fixed no. of times in a year it will be checked and then they are liable to increase your load demand .So say if in a house, a marriage or a renovation work is happening,
                then this MDI gets obviously recorded ,but logically it's not the true load of the home ( as they don't organize the marriage for a full year) . This is where the loop hole resides. The company simply increases it and you will pay more. You can
                write an application for it that the load was for a particular concern and not the actual load as whenever the sanction load demand increases, then the per unit slab also increases. So you can save a lot as a bill of ₹1000 for particular units 
                of consumption can go for ₹6000(along with fixed charges increases).<br />
            I hope you all find it useful and will save the planet by acting smartly.!!!!good luck.Please feel free to ask me any questions.

            1.	All the heating equipment’s costumes more power which are more power consuming as per the watt ratings. So to use them , please switch off all the unnecessary appliances till the time of operation of the heating equipment.<br />
            2.	The heavy loads must be operated to power switches and plugs only which have proper earthing. Also please have separate earthing in complete premise.<br />
            3.	When you run a washing machine , please off the refrigerator/AC till the time of operation of washing machine. It saves the electricity current demand of home.<br />
            4.	Those appliances which heats too much must get serviced periodically as heating means loss of power .<br />
            5.	Whenever you run your computer .please use a ups compulsorily as the data of computer HDD will not get corrupted easily due to transient effects of voltage fluctuations.<br />
